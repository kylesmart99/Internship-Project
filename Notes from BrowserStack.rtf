\f0\fs24 \cf0 Found out that Browserstack doesn\'92t work with Local Host (which I expected). However, if I download the desktop client for BrowserStack I can access localhost.\
Browserstack has a tutorial when you start an account which walks the user through running their first test.\
Live testing has lag to it.}
